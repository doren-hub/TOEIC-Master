# Repository instructions

Follow [docs/development-workflow.md](docs/development-workflow.md) for all implementation work. If `docs/roadmap.md` exists, use it to order implementation issues. Otherwise, use explicitly requested issues or the repository’s GitHub issue priorities and dependencies.

## Required delivery loop

Target branch: `main` (`base_branch` in `.kurukuru.toml`, default `main`). Create work branches and PRs against this branch.

1. Work on exactly one open implementation issue at a time, following the issue selection rules in `docs/development-workflow.md`.
2. Create a branch named `codex/<short-description>`.
3. At the beginning of the issue, create an empty kickoff commit, push the branch, and open a Draft PR containing `Closes #<issue>`.
4. Implement the complete issue, including tests, static checks, documentation, and PR-body updates.
5. Run an independent Claude Code review with Claude Opus 5.5 at low effort (`kurukuru review <issue> <pr>`). Preserve and reuse the same Claude review session for every re-review of that PR.
6. Fix every actionable in-scope finding, rerun verification, and ask Claude to review again. Repeat until Claude explicitly returns `OK`.
7. If Claude identifies a worthwhile improvement outside the current issue, create a separate GitHub issue with acceptance criteria and continue the current issue without expanding its scope.
8. After the configured local test command verification and Claude returns `OK`, update the PR body with final changes, verification results, limitations, and follow-up issues; mark the PR ready; wait for CI to pass; merge it; verify the linked issue closed; then begin the next issue if it is within the owner’s requested scope.
9. Continue this loop until all selected issues are closed, within the owner’s requested scope.

## Sessions

Run each issue in a fresh Codex session (`kurukuru run`) and follow the context-budget and per-session `ai-dispatch-log` rules in `docs/development-workflow.md`.

The owner or outer orchestrator starts those sessions. Inside a runner session, never invoke `kurukuru run`, `kurukuru exec`, or `kurukuru queue` (including `queue run`), or `kurukuru batch`: this would recursively start runners. Complete only the assigned issue in the current session. `kurukuru review` and `kurukuru ci-wait` remain available.

## Worktree locations

- Queue-managed worktrees are reserved for kurukuru. In particular, `[runner].worktree_path` in `.kurukuru.toml` (default `.worktrees/kurukuru-run`, relative to the source repository) is queue-only: when working outside the queue, never create or use a worktree at that path. Do not reuse automatically allocated queue worktrees either.
- For direct app sessions or other work outside the queue, create a separate linked worktree from the source repository at `../<repo>-codex-manual-<issue>`; replace `<repo>` with the source repository name and `<issue>` with the issue number. Check `git worktree list` and the configured queue path first. If the manual path is occupied or resolves to a queue path, choose a new unused `-<session>` suffix; never take over an existing worktree.
- Finish and preserve the work before cleanup. After committing, pushing and completing delivery, leave the manual worktree and run `git worktree remove <manual-path>` from the source repository. If removal refuses because of remaining changes, preserve and resolve them; do not force removal. Queue worktrees are cleaned up by kurukuru, not by direct app sessions.

## Configured project constraints

The constraints below come from `.kurukuru.toml`. Also follow the
[repository-local instructions](#repository-local-instructions), including any
additional project constraints and roadmap guidance there.

- Preserve the React/Vite application, vocabulary data and existing README; onboarding does not change product behavior.
- Never read credentials, .env* or auth.json, and never run Gemini-backed vocabulary generation during verification.
- Preserve project instructions in AGENTS.local.md and unique document content before regenerating managed documents.
- Use existing self-hosted macOS CI capacity only; do not register runners or bypass permissions.

## Verification

- Test: `npm run build`
- Lint: `npm run lint`

## Additional review notes

- Require head-bound local build/lint evidence while Draft and standalone OK before Ready; reuse the same review session.
- Merge only after kurukuru ci-wait exits 0 for the reviewed head; No CI is not sufficient.

## Repository-local instructions

# TOEIC-Master project instructions

## Existing project and verification

- This is a React 19 / TypeScript / Vite 6 application with Tailwind CSS 4. Keep the existing README and its AI Studio reference intact.
- Install locked dependencies with `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund`. Node.js is required; CI uses Node.js 24. The repository previously declared no minimum Node version.
- `npm run dev` serves on port 5173; `npm run build` produces `dist/`; `npm run lint` runs `tsc --noEmit`.
- There is no unit-test script or test suite. The configured `test` is the production build; it does not verify browser interactions or external APIs.
- `src/data/words.json` is the vocabulary source, imported through `src/data/words.ts`. Do not regenerate or change vocabulary as part of onboarding.
- `scripts/generate-words.mjs` and `scripts/import-tsl.mjs` use Gemini, read environment files and modify vocabulary. Do not execute these during onboarding or routine verification. Never read credentials, `.env*` (including examples) or `auth.json`.
- User profiles and learning progress use browser localStorage. Preserve existing storage formats and application behavior.

## Delivery and preservation

- Follow `.cursor/rules/common.mdc` if it is introduced. No repository AGENTS.md, AGENTS.local.md, workflow document, kurukuru config, Cursor rules or CI workflow existed at onboarding baseline `f4af519`.
- Use `codex/<short-description>`, an empty kickoff commit and a Draft PR starting with `Closes #<issue>`; put a linked task card in Doing when one exists.
- Preserve unique content before replacing generated documents; keep project-specific guidance here, retain applicable settings in `.kurukuru.toml`, regenerate with `kurukuru init`, and require `kurukuru init --check` to exit 0.
- Before Ready, the PR body must include background, main changes, tests/static checks and results, known limitations or review notes, and the closing issue reference.
- Independent Claude Opus 5.5 low-effort review is strictly Read/Glob/Grep-only (`[review].read_only = true`), with a persistent session for every re-review. Supply local command, execution time, duration, head SHA and exit code. Keep Draft until standalone `OK` for that exact head.
- After Ready, invoke `kurukuru ci-wait` once per reviewed head and wait for its final summary. Merge only on exit 0 with `--match-head-commit`; No CI never authorizes merging here. Failures retain Ready and require fixes, fresh local checks and re-review in the same session.
- The owner has approved the normal PR/review/merge workflow for onboarding issue #7 only. Do not start other issues, recursively launch kurukuru run/exec/queue/batch, register runners or bypass permissions.
- The caller owns ai-dispatch-log recording for this onboarding: do not call start, finish, codex-attach or antigravity-attach. In future sessions follow the dispatch ownership rules in the generated workflow.
- Work only in the independent onboarding clone. Never change `/Users/doren/Developer/TOEIC-Master`, and do not register either checkout during this task. After merge, tell the owner to fast-forward the original when safe, then run `kurukuru repos add /Users/doren/Developer/TOEIC-Master`.


## Autonomy

- Do not request routine user approval between implementation steps, reviews, PR operations, merges, or issue transitions. The repository owner has authorized this workflow.
- Preserve normal tool, operating-system, repository, and agent safety controls. Never bypass permission systems merely to avoid a prompt.
- Ask the user only when work requires authority not already granted, a product decision that materially changes scope, an unavailable credential/account action, or recovery from an unsafe/destructive ambiguity.
- When an external service is temporarily unavailable, retry safe operations and continue other in-scope work before treating it as a blocker.

## CI waiting

After Ready, invoke `kurukuru ci-wait <pr>` once per reviewed head and wait for its final summary. Supply that final summary plus its pinned head SHA as Ready CI evidence. Do not repeatedly poll `gh pr checks`. Merge on exit 0, or on exit 4 (No CI) only with local verification and Claude OK for the same head recorded in the PR body; head changes require fresh verification and review. Failures retain Ready and follow the repair/re-review loop.

For sessions launched by `kurukuru run`, the runner prompt supplies a stricter merge policy: exit 0 only by default. Repository-only `[ci] merge_without_ci = true` additionally permits exit 4 (No CI) only with freshly passed configured local `test` and Claude OK for the same current head. Record the head SHA, ci-wait final summary, test command, execution time, exit code and result in the PR body. Merge using `--match-head-commit <verified-head-SHA>`. An empty or missing `test` forbids this exception. Legacy exit 5, failed, pending, cancelled, skipped, unavailable or timed-out CI do not qualify for the runner exception. A head change invalidates all evidence: rerun local verification, obtain Claude OK and wait for CI on the new head. The documented workflow above is unchanged; this opt-in changes only runner instructions.

## CI rules

- Every workflow must set `concurrency: { group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}, cancel-in-progress: true }` to cancel superseded runs.
- Do not run CI for Draft PRs. Gate PR jobs with `if: github.event.pull_request.draft == false` and include `ready_for_review` in pull request event types so marking Ready starts CI.
- When adding a macOS job, require a `paths` filter limited to the app's files and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; for mixed-platform workflows, use job-level path detection so unrelated Linux checks still run. Use `runs-on: [self-hosted, macOS]` for all jobs; never fall back to paid GitHub-hosted runners. Guard every PR job with `github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository` to exclude forks. Disable checkout credential persistence and clean the workspace before and after each job. See [owner setup and offline operation](https://github.com/doren-hub/kurukuru/blob/main/docs/self-hosted-runners.md).
- Self-hosted macOS jobs must use `python3` from the runner account PATH and verify Python 3.11.8 or newer before tests. Do not use `actions/setup-python`: it forces a GitHub-hosted macOS cache path. Install Python beforehand (for example with Homebrew); the runner PATH is captured at registration. Do not change runner configuration files.
- Run the configured local test command (`test` in `.kurukuru.toml`) and lint command (`lint`, when configured), and pass both before starting CI.
- Do not start Docker or any container/VM runtime unless the owner explicitly requests it.

## Claude review guidance

The default review contract is in
[the development workflow](docs/development-workflow.md#default-claude-review-contract).
[Repository-local instructions](#repository-local-instructions), sourced from
`AGENTS.local.md` when present, take precedence over the generated review defaults.
Apply stricter local reviewer permissions and evidence requirements; the defaults
never authorize expanding those permissions. Keep local instructions verbatim.

## Creating issues

Classify every issue you create with labels. The canonical rules are `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/labels.yml` in doren-hub/build-next (aligned with main revision `81f872a151765fdb6191e4f6c92a969dee0003fd`). Ask before creating an issue when the type or domain is unclear.

- Exactly one type label, and a matching title prefix:
  - `type: 機能追加` `[機能追加]`: adds a new capability (feature, part, circuit block).
  - `type: 機能改善` `[機能改善]`: improves something that already works (speed, robustness, usability, size, noise). Also use it for things that are risky or slow but have not actually malfunctioned.
  - `type: 不具合修正` `[不具合]`: something does not meet its specification or expectation and has actually misbehaved.
  - `type: 調査` `[調査]`: research whose main output is a decision or document (comparison, selection, PoC to decide feasibility).
  - `type: 検証` `[検証]`: checks that something already built meets its requirements (real hardware, prototype, measurement).
  - `type: タスク` `[タスク]`: work that does not change product behavior (CI, tests, refactoring, migration, settings, docs, drawings, ordering, BOM).
- One or more domain labels: `domain: ソフト` (runs on an OS, including ROS 2), `domain: メカ` (enclosures, mechanisms, parts), `domain: 回路` (schematics, boards), `domain: ファーム` (runs directly on a microcontroller). Add several when the work spans domains.
- A missing requirement in a design (for example, no place for a required part) is `type: 機能追加`.
- When the main output is a decision or document, use `type: 調査`. When the output is code or drawings, use `type: 機能追加` or `type: 機能改善`, even for a PoC.
- Add `tracking` to parent issues that summarize the progress of other issues. Owner decision (2026-10-29): `tracking` exempts only the CI classification check; at creation, tracking issues must still have exactly one `type:` label and one or more `domain:` labels, the matching title prefix, and the required body format.
- Add `owner-action` when the owner must act (hardware operation, production change, ordering, credentials).
- Use repository-specific `area:`, `phase:`, or `priority:` labels when needed.
- Do not use GitHub's default `enhancement`, `bug`, or `documentation` labels, or the automatic `type: 未分類` / `domain: 未分類` labels.
- Start the body with `### 分野` listing the chosen domains separated by commas (for example, `ソフト, 回路`), then use the headings of the matching issue template below, in order. These headings are included here so issue creation does not depend on the forms being distributed to the repository.

| Type | Body headings |
| --- | --- |
| `type: 機能追加` | 分野 / 目的・背景 / 実現したいこと / 関連する要件 / 完了条件 |
| `type: 機能改善` | 分野 / 対象 / 現状の課題 / 改善案 / 関連する要件 / 完了条件 |
| `type: 不具合修正` | 分野 / 現象 / 発生条件・再現手順 / 期待する状態 / 対象 / 環境・補足 |
| `type: 調査` | 分野 / 調べたいこと / 判断に使う観点 / 成果物 |
| `type: 検証` | 分野 / 対象 / 確かめる要件 / 方法・条件 / 合格の基準 / 結果 |
| `type: タスク` | 分野 / 内容 |

## Pull request body

Before marking a PR ready, include:

- summary and background;
- main changes;
- tests and static checks with results;
- known limitations, deferred work, and review notes;
- `Closes #<issue>`.

## Draft verification

Keep PRs Draft through the configured local test command and Claude review until `OK`.
Supply local execution time, head SHA, command, and exit code instead of Draft CI.
The reviewer must not return `OK` for missing evidence or a SHA different from
the current PR head. Ready CI is the final gate. If it fails, keep the PR Ready,
fix and push, rerun local checks, and re-review the changed diff in the same
Claude session until `OK`, then wait for CI on that head before merging.
